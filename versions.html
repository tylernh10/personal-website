                                The site finally has some new updates! A lot of these changes have to do with updates to the previous CSS implementation, which had some issues. For example, the menu on the bottom of the screen did not have universal formatting. Instead, it had a position style of relative and the margin-top size was being changed to suit the specific page's content. Instead, the new version has absolute positioning (until the screen height reaches a certain value). Furthermore, the content on the main page was positioned haphazardly, which was changed with this release. The new joke page doesn't have much more function than my brief practice with API requests. Unfortunately, the CSS on this site is still a bit cluttered, though it has been improved since the last release. Especially for the release of my main site, I want to prioritize organization and a more structured approach to my styling. On this site, I also have been working on a dark mode/light mode feature, though this has not been completed yet. This site has needed some changes since its last release in February, and it finally got them. More to be released soon!

It mainly relates to the background on the site changing, which necessitated changes to the formatting of text (putting a slightly transparent background on everything). Furthermore, the favicon was updated, and several other stylistic updates were made. This marks the first official version change since release. Several small changes will be made in the near future, likely to be recognized in the version log (unlike some previous changes).</div>
